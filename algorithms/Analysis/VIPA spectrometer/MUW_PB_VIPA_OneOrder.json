    "description": "This algorithm extracts a frequency axis from an interference spectrum obtained between two elastic peaks with only two visible inelastic peaks. The frequency axis is interpolated by a polynomial of order 2. This polynomial verifies that the distance between the inelastic peaks and elastic peaks of corresponding order of diffraction is the same. The value of the frequency shift is obtained by using the known FSR of the etalon used for diffraction.\nWith this approach, the first elastic peak is set as the 0 of the frequency axis",

Each point is an intensity extremum obtained by fitting a quadratic polynomial to the windowed data.\nThe point is given as a value on the x axis (not a position).\nThe \"position_center_window\" parameter is the center of the window surrounding the peak. The \"window_width\" parameter is the width of the window surrounding the peak (full width). The \"type_pnt\" parameter is the type of the peak. It can be either \"Stokes\", \"Anti-Stokes\" or \"Elastic\".\n\nParameters\n----------\nposition_center_window : float\n    A value on the self.x axis corresponding to the center of a window surrounding a peak\nwindow : float\n    A value on the self.x axis corresponding to the width of a window surrounding a peak\ntype_pnt : str\n    The nature of the peak.

By imposing that the distance in frequency between two neighboring elastic peaks is one FSR, and that the shift of both stokes and anti-stokes peaks to their respective elastic peak is the same, we can obtain a frequency axis. The user has to enter a value for the FSR to calibrate the frequency axis.\n\nParameters\n----------  \nFSR : float\n    The free spectral range of the VIPA spectrometer (in GHz).\n"
