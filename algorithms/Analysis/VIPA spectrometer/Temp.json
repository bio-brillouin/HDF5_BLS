    "description": "This algorithm allows the user to recover a frequency axis basing ourselves on a single Brillouin spectrum obtained with a VIPA spectrometer. Considering that only one Brillouin Stokes and anti-Stokes doublet is visible on the spectrum, the user can select the peaks he sees, and then perform a quadratic interpolation to obtain the frequency axis. This interpolation is obtained either by entering a value for the Brillouin shift of the material or by entering the value of the Free Spectral Range (FSR) of the spectrometer. The user can finally recenter the spectrum either using the average between a Stokes and an anti-Stokes peak or by choosing an elastic peak as zero frequency.",
