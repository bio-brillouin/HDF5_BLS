This format is designed to unify the way to store data in the BioBrillouin Community. From there, we propose to unify the treatment and analysis of the data. The storage being independent from the analysis, we propose to create an intermediate step where a Power Spectral Density is obtained.

The treatment of any PSD being essentially the same: a fitting of one or several lineshapes that takes into account the response of the instrument to deconvolve its effect, we further propose to unify the analysis after obtaining the PSD. This results in the following pipeline for any BLS experiment

On this figure, the left side represents the steps of the pipeline, while the right side represents the steps that the HDF5\_BLS package is designed to perform.
