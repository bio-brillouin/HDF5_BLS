This project aims at defining a standard for storing Brillouin Light Scattering measures and associated treatment in a HDF5 file.

HDF5 stands for "Hierarchical Data Format" and is a file format that allows the storage of data in a hierarchical structure. This structure allows to store data in a way that is both human and machine readable. The structure of the file is based on the following base structure, which corresponds to the structure of a file containing a single measure (\textit{Measure}) where no parameters have been stored:

\begin{verbatim}
    file.h5
    +-- Brillouin (group)
    |   +-- Measure (group)
    |   |   +-- Measure (dataset)
\end{verbatim}

The dimensionality of the dataset is free, there are therefore by design virtually no restrictions on the data that can be stored in this format.

In order to organize the measures, we impose a maximum of one measure per group. This condition will be implemented by the library as will be described later on.
