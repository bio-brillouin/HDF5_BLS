The vision of the project is to unify all BLS data into a single HDF5 file. This file will be used to store all the data and metadata of the BLS. The data will be stored in a hierarchical structure, all the data related to BLS being stored the "Data" group. This choice allows results from other techinques to be stored in the same file, only in other, independent groups, to minimize the risk of nomenclature competition between techinques. The "Data" group will contain all the data. These data are arranged in groups, whose identifiers are "Data\_i". Each group can only contain one measure, in the form of an array, whose dimension is however not restricted. This measure will be called "Raw\_data". The attributes of the measure are stored in the group attributes.

The following structure represents the base structure of the file:

\begin{verbatim}
    file.h5
    +-- Data (group)
    |   +-- Data_1 (group)
    |   |   +-- Raw_data (dataset)
\end{verbatim}
