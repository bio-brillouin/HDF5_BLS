The \texttt{Wrapper} object is the main class of the package. Its role is to interface the HDF5 file and the code while ensuring a safe access to the data and a conservation of the structure of the file. This class is meant to do these four actions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Create a structure that is universal to the BioBrillouin community in a seamless manner.
    \item Allow the user to acces the data and attributes of the file.
    \item Allow the user to add data to the file with attributes that are specific to the BioBrillouin community.
    \item Allow the user to add or modify attributes of the file.
\end{itemize}

To use this object, the user must first import it from the HDF5\_BLS package:
\begin{lstlisting}
from HDF5_BLS.wrapper import Wrapper
\end{lstlisting}
