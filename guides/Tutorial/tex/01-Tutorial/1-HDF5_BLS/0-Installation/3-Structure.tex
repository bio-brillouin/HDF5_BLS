The HDF5\_BLS package is built around the following different modules:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{wrapper}: This module is used to interact with HDF5 files. It is used to read the data, to write the data and to modify any aspect of the HDF5 file (dataset, groups or attributes).
    \item \texttt{analyze}: This module is used to convert raw data taken from a spectrometer into a physically meaningful Power Spectral Density (PSD) array. This process is done to be reliable 
    \item \texttt{treat}: This module is used to extract information from the PSD array, such as the frequency shift and line width of the spectral lines. 
    \item \texttt{load\_data}: This module is used to import data from any formats of interest. This module is an interface between physical files stored on the PC and the wrapper module. It has been designed to be easily extended to any format of data.
\end{itemize}

In the following chapters, we will focus on the different modules.
