The treatment module has the particularity of being able to be used in four different ways:
\begin{itemize}
    \item To simply use the functions it provides to treat the data
    \item To define a new treatment algorithm
    \item To apply an existing treatment algorithm to the data
    \item To re-use an existing treatment and optimize it
\end{itemize}

In the following sections, we'll present the choices made for its development and the different ways to use the treatment module.
