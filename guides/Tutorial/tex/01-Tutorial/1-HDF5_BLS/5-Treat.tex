The treat module is the module that allows the user to extract information from a Power Spectrum Density. The module can work with all PSD relying on a 1D frequency vector and where the frequency dependence is the last dimension of the PSD. The module allows a seemless storage of the functions that have been called during a treatment. This allows the user to easily store the treatment but also reapply it to the data if needed. This chapter will present the way the module works then the way it can be used and finally how the module can be extended.

The philosophy of the treat module is to apply functions from the class to treat the data. This choice allows for the class to store any of the algorithm steps that have been applied to the data.
