All the classes of the analysis module are built following a Object-Oriented approach and rely on 5 core attributes:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{\_algorithm}: A JSON file describing a particular sequence of functions to be applied for the analysis
    \item \textit{x}: The abscissa of the data on which we perform the analysis
    \item \textit{y}: The data points that are to be analyzed
    \item \textit{points}: A dictionnary of points on which to base the analysis
    \item \textit{windows}: A dictionnary of windows on which to base the analysis
\end{itemize}

Additionaly, a sixth attribute, \textit{\_history} is used to store the evolution of each attribute during the analysis. This is however a "silent" attribute that the developper should not consider as it is automatically updated as will be explained in the following sections.
