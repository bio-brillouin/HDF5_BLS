In this fourth example, we want to store a single measure of a water sample. This measure has been converted into a Power Spectrum Density.

The following structure represents the base structure of the file:
\begin{verbatim}
    file.h5
    +-- Data (group) -> Name = "Measure"
    |   +-- Data_0 (group) -> Name = "Water"
    |   |   +-- Raw_data (dataset)
    |   |   +-- PSD (dataset)
    |   |   +-- Frequency (dataset)
\end{verbatim}
Note that we have here added arrows and an example of the value of the "Name" attributes.
In this case, all the steps of the conversion to PSD are stored in the "Data\_0" group. The nomenclature of the attribute(s) used to store the parameters of the treatment is not specified.
