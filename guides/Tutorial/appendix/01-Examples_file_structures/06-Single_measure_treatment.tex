In this sixth example, we want to store a single measure of a water sample that has been treated.

The following structure represents the base structure of the file:
\begin{verbatim}
    file.h5
    +-- Data (group) -> Name = "Measure"
    |   +-- Data_0 (group) -> Name = "Water"
    |   |   +-- Raw_data (dataset)
    |   |   +-- PSD (dataset)
    |   |   +-- Frequency (dataset)
    |   |   +-- Treat_0 (group) -> Name = "Treat_5GHz"
    |   |   |   +-- Shift (dataset)
    |   |   |   +-- Shift_std (dataset)
    |   |   |   +-- Linewidth (dataset)
    |   |   |   +-- Linewidth_std (dataset)
\end{verbatim}
Note that we have here added arrows and an example of the value of the "Name" attributes.
In this case, all the steps of the treatment are stored in the "Treat\_0" group. The nomenclature of the attribute(s) used to store the parameters of the treatment is not specified.
