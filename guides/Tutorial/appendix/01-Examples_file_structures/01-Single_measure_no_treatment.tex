In this first example, we want to store a single measure of a water sample.
    
The following structure represents the base structure of the file:
\begin{verbatim}
    file.h5
    +-- Data (group) -> Name = "Measure"
    |   +-- Data_0 (group) -> Name = "Water"
    |   |   +-- Raw_data (dataset)
\end{verbatim}
Note that we have here added arrows and an example of the value of the "Name" attributes.
